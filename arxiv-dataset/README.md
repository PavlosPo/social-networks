This is a repository in order to make some research on the field of Molecules and Protein-protein relationships, due to a master's project.

We will provide some code from an other repository in order to guied us.

Note 1: 
* I think we can use the [datasets](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets) link, taking the dataset directly from the torch_geometric library. There is the *ogbn-mag* dataset there.

Possible Questions on the OGBN-ARXIV dataset: 
* How to find the important papers ? What characteristics are having ? 
* Can we make them more visible per topic ? Can I get the most important/base papers in Chemistry ? Biology ? e.t.c.?
